Dit is voor de geweldige speech zometeen!
Thank you Gert Jan for this talk!
I hope that everyone enjoyed the training and tried some things themselves. 
We of course have the GIT training next week, where we will dive somewhat deeper into the workings behind the sharing of code. 
We have a survey and by filling it in we can adjust the next training accordingly which would be super nice and of course handy for you too!
TRAIN offers more of these trainings so take a look at some of the GEWIS activities from time to time!
There is time for questions now, so please go ahead with trying out some of the things we talked about and don't be shy!
